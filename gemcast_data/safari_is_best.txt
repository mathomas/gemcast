Safari Looks Best
During the testing (on my Mac) of gemcast, written in <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com">Ruby</a>, I have discovered that Safari has clearly the best rendering over IE and Chimera.  This page looks essentially perfect in Safari, while bits like the "powered by" box, below, look pretty crappy in the others.
