The version of gemcast that this license file is packaged with is free for to use as you see fit (if you see fit to delete it from your system immediately, I understand).  All I ask is that you don't take credit for any of it (as if you would), and that you drop me a note to let me know you're using it.

Legalese:
Gemcast comes with no implied or expressed guarantees of merchantability or fitness to a particular task.  If you choose to use it, you waive any right to claim damages against me (Mike Thomas) of any sort.
